# Spatial 3D

This project is currently just a placeholder for some investigative work in developing utilties for working with 3D objects.
It is inspired by my previous experience with 2D libraries like JTS, and interest in seeing if I could develop a simple subset
of 3D geometries and 3D algorithms.

## Some ideas

Some ideas I'd like to try:

* Point in polygin in 3D
* Polygon touch, intersection, contains, etc.

## Related to

Currently this is a standalone project, but I have interest in integrating or connecting it to Neo4j and possibly Neo4j Spatial,
expecially since Neo4j 3.4 includes 3D point support.

For this reason I might also include Neo4j procedures for doing 3D analysis with polygons within Neo4j 3.4 or later.
